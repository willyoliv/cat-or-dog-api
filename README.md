# cat-or-dog-api

THE BEGINNING:

This is one of the first projects initiated by Laboratorios Lambda, in order to initiate researchers in the field of neural networks and 
artificial intelligence, although simple and small, these are the first steps towards much larger projects and research.

This API is used to identify DOGS and CATS, just that, but our wish is for this to go even further...
